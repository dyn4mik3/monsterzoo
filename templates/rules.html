    <h3>Player Decks:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player starts with a personal deck consisting of 6 Dirty Socks 
        (a food) and 4 Zookee Zoogly (a monster) cards.</li>
        <li>Remove additional copies of Dirty Socks and Zookee Zoogly. Do not 
        use them during the game.</li>
        <li>Each player shuffles his deck and draws 5 cards (leaving 5 cards in 
        his deck).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Wild:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shuffle all of the other cards face down to form The Wild Deck.</li>
        <li>From The Wild Deck, flip 5 cards face up in a row between all players. This forms The Wild.</li>
        <li>Reserve space next to The Wild Deck for the Clearing. Any cards that are removed from the game go to the Clearing.</li>

    <h2 id="cardtypes">Card Types</h2>

    <p>There are two types of cards in the game: Food and Monsters</p>

    <h3>Food</h3>

    <img class="img-responsive" src="/static/images/food-card.png" width="300px">

    <p>Food allows you to aquire Monsters or more Food.</p>
    
    <p>To catch Monsters or Food from The Wild, play Food cards (and/or Monster 
    cards that give you Food) equal to the food cost of the Monster or Food card 
    you are acquiring. The amount needed to gain a Monster or Food card is located 
    in the upper left corner of the card.</p>

    <p>Cards gained from The Wild always go directly to your discard pile. Draw 
    a new card from The Wild Deck to replace the empty spot left by the card you 
    just caught.</p>
    
    <h3>Monsters</h3>

    <img class="img-responsive" src="/static/images/monster-card.png" width="300px">

    <p>When you play a Monster card from your hand, you gain the effect listed 
    on the card. It stays in front of you until the end of the turn, and then 
    it goes to your discard pile.</p>

    <p>There are three types of Monsters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Oogly (Purple Background) - These monsters are festive and love food. 
        Playing Oogly cards will typically give you food to help catch Monsters 
        from The Wild.</li>
        <li>Boogly (Red Background) - These monsters are fast and quick. Playing 
        Boogly cards will usually help you draw more cards.</li>
        <li>Zoogly (Blue Background) - These monsters help manage your Zoo. 
        Playing Zoogly cards will generally help you move Monsters into your Zoo.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="yourzoo">Your Zoo</h2>

    <p>Your Zoo is a special area in front of you where you will be placing 
    Monster cards. Monster cards that are placed in your Zoo stay there until the 
    end of the game, unless they are forced out by another card’s effect. Monster
    cards in your Zoo (not your hand or discard or pile) are with points equal to 
    their food cost.</p>

    <h2 id="movingmonsters">Moving Monsters to Your Zoo</h2>

    <p>To move a Monster to your Zoo, you’ll need the help of a Monster with the 
    effect allowing you to move a Monster to your Zoo. Play the Monster card with 
    the effect in front of you and then take a different Monster from your hand 
    and place that card into your Zoo.</p>

    <p>For example, you will start the game with 4 Zookee Zoogly cards in your 
    deck. Zookee Zoogly has the listed effect “Move a monster card from your hand 
    into your Zoo.” If you had a hand with a Zookee Zoogly and a Boo Boogly 
    (another Monster card), you could play Zookee Zoogly, and then move Boo Boogly 
    into your Zoo.</p>

    <h2 id="zooeffects">Playing With Zoo Effects</h2>

    <p>Some Monsters have a Zoo Effect that you can use once per turn if the 
    Monster is in your Zoo. To use a zoo effect, follow the directions on the 
    Monster card that is in your zoo.</p>

    <h2 id="play">Play</h2>

    <p>General Rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>At any time, if your personal deck is empty and you need to draw a 
        card, reshuffle your discard pile to replenish your deck.</li>
        <li>Cards played during your turn go to your discard pile.</li>
        <li>Food and Monsters you catch during your turn are placed in your discard pile.</li>
        <li>Whenever a card leaves The Wild, replace it immediately with a new card from The Wild Deck. There should always be 5 cards in The Wild.</li>
        <li>If the card text ever contradicts the rules, follow the card text instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Turn Breakdown:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use Zoo Effects (if there are any Monsters with Zoo Effects in your Zoo).</li>
        <li>Play any number of cards from your hand. Follow the listed effect on the cards. Place played cards in your discard pile. Monsters in your Zoo remain there and are not discarded.</li>
        <li>At any time during your turn, you may use Food gained from your played cards to catch Monsters or Food from The Wild and place them in your discard pile.</li>
        <li>Continue playing cards from your hand until you decide to stop or have no more cards in your hand.</li>
        <li>Discard as many cards as you want. Draw until you have 5 cards. If you have more than 5 cards at the end of your turn, discard until you have 5 cards in your hand.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To play a card from your hand, place the card face up in front of you, announce 
    its effect, and follow the instructions on the card.</p>

    <h2 id="endingturn">Ending Your Turn</h2>

    <p>When you are done playing cards, take all the cards you played this turn 
    (Monsters and Food) and put them face up in your discard pile. Monster cards 
    in your Zoo are not considered played cards. Leave them in the Zoo.</p>

    <p>Discard as many cards as you want. Draw until you have 5 cards. If you have 
    more than 5 cards at the end of your turn, discard until you have 5 cards in 
    your hand. If you run out of cards in your deck to draw from, shuffle your 
    discard pile to create a new deck. Draw cards from the new deck.</p>

    <h2 id="gameend">Game End</h2>

    <p>The game is over as soon as one player has 30 points worth of monsters in 
    their Zoo, or as soon as one player has two of each kind of monster (Oogly, 
    Boogly, and Zoogly) in their Zoo. That player is declared Master Monster 
    Zookeeper and wins the game!</p>
